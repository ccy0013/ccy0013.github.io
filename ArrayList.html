public class ArrayList<E>
extends AbstractList<E>
implements List<E>, RandomAccess, Cloneable, Serializable
Resizable-array implementation of the List interface. Implements all optional list operations, and permits all elements, including null. In addition to implementing the List interface, this class provides methods to manipulate the size of the array that is used internally to store the list. (This class is roughly equivalent to Vector, except that it is unsynchronized.)
The size, isEmpty, get, set, iterator, and listIterator operations run in constant time. The add operation runs in amortized constant time, that is, adding n elements requires O(n) time. All of the other operations run in linear time (roughly speaking). The constant factor is low compared to that for the LinkedList implementation.

Each ArrayList instance has a capacity. The capacity is the size of the array used to store the elements in the list. It is always at least as large as the list size. As elements are added to an ArrayList, its capacity grows automatically. The details of the growth policy are not specified beyond the fact that adding an element has constant amortized time cost.

An application can increase the capacity of an ArrayList instance before adding a large number of elements using the ensureCapacity operation. This may reduce the amount of incremental reallocation.

Constructor and Description
ArrayList()
Constructs an empty list with an initial capacity of ten.
ArrayList(Collection<? extends E> c)
Constructs a list containing the elements of the specified collection, in the order they are returned by the collection's iterator.
ArrayList(int initialCapacity)
Constructs an empty list with the specified initial capacity.

trimToSize
public void trimToSize()
Trims the capacity of this ArrayList instance to be the list's current size. An application can use this operation to minimize the storage of an ArrayList instance.

ensureCapacity
public void ensureCapacity(int minCapacity)
Increases the capacity of this ArrayList instance, if necessary, to ensure that it can hold at least the number of elements specified by the minimum capacity argument.
Parameters:
minCapacity - the desired minimum capacity

contains
public boolean contains(Object o)
Returns true if this list contains the specified element. More formally, returns true if and only if this list contains at least one element e such that (o==null ? e==null : o.equals(e)).
Specified by:
contains in interface Collection<E>
Specified by:
contains in interface List<E>
Overrides:
contains in class AbstractCollection<E>
Parameters:
o - element whose presence in this list is to be tested
Returns:
true if this list contains the specified element

lastIndexOf
public int lastIndexOf(Object o)
Returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in this list, or -1 if this list does not contain the element. More formally, returns the highest index i such that (o==null ? get(i)==null : o.equals(get(i))), or -1 if there is no such index.
Specified by:
lastIndexOf in interface List<E>
Overrides:
lastIndexOf in class AbstractList<E>
Parameters:
o - element to search for
Returns:
the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in this list, or -1 if this list does not contain the element

toArray
public Object[] toArray()
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence (from first to last element).
The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are maintained by this list. (In other words, this method must allocate a new array). The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.
This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs.
Specified by:
toArray in interface Collection<E>
Specified by:
toArray in interface List<E>
Overrides:
toArray in class AbstractCollection<E>
Returns:
an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence

get
public E get(int index)
Returns the element at the specified position in this list.
Specified by:
get in interface List<E>
Specified by:
get in class AbstractList<E>
Parameters:
index - index of the element to return
Returns:
the element at the specified position in this list
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException - if the index is out of range (index < 0 || index >= size())

set
public E set(int index,
    E element)
	Replaces the element at the specified position in this list with the specified element.
	Specified by:
	set in interface List<E>
	Overrides:
	set in class AbstractList<E>
	Parameters:
	index - index of the element to replace
	element - element to be stored at the specified position
	Returns:
	the element previously at the specified position
	Throws:
	IndexOutOfBoundsException - if the index is out of range (index < 0 || index >= size())

add
public boolean add(E e)
Appends the specified element to the end of this list.
Specified by:
add in interface Collection<E>
Specified by:
add in interface List<E>
Overrides:
add in class AbstractList<E>
Parameters:
e - element to be appended to this list
Returns:
true (as specified by Collection.add(E))

add
public void add(int index,
       E element)
	   Inserts the specified element at the specified position in this list. Shifts the element currently at that position (if any) and any subsequent elements to the right (adds one to their indices).
	   Specified by:
	   add in interface List<E>
	   Overrides:
	   add in class AbstractList<E>
	   Parameters:
	   index - index at which the specified element is to be inserted
	   element - element to be inserted
	   Throws:
	   IndexOutOfBoundsException - if the index is out of range (index < 0 || index > size())

remove
public E remove(int index)
Removes the element at the specified position in this list. Shifts any subsequent elements to the left (subtracts one from their indices).
Specified by:
remove in interface List<E>
Overrides:
remove in class AbstractList<E>
Parameters:
index - the index of the element to be removed
Returns:
the element that was removed from the list
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException - if the index is out of range (index < 0 || index >= size())

remove
public boolean remove(Object o)
Removes the first occurrence of the specified element from this list, if it is present. If the list does not contain the element, it is unchanged. More formally, removes the element with the lowest index i such that (o==null ? get(i)==null : o.equals(get(i))) (if such an element exists). Returns true if this list contained the specified element (or equivalently, if this list changed as a result of the call).
Specified by:
remove in interface Collection<E>
Specified by:
remove in interface List<E>
Overrides:
remove in class AbstractCollection<E>
Parameters:
o - element to be removed from this list, if present
Returns:
true if this list contained the specified element

addAll
public boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)
Appends all of the elements in the specified collection to the end of this list, in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's Iterator. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress. (This implies that the behavior of this call is undefined if the specified collection is this list, and this list is nonempty.)
Specified by:
addAll in interface Collection<E>
Specified by:
addAll in interface List<E>
Overrides:
addAll in class AbstractCollection<E>
Parameters:
c - collection containing elements to be added to this list
Returns:
true if this list changed as a result of the call
Throws:
NullPointerException - if the specified collection is null

addAll
public boolean addAll(int index,
             Collection<? extends E> c)
			 Inserts all of the elements in the specified collection into this list, starting at the specified position. Shifts the element currently at that position (if any) and any subsequent elements to the right (increases their indices). The new elements will appear in the list in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's iterator.
			 Specified by:
			 addAll in interface List<E>
			 Overrides:
			 addAll in class AbstractList<E>
			 Parameters:
			 index - index at which to insert the first element from the specified collection
			 c - collection containing elements to be added to this list
